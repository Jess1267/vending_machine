# Vending_Machine
# Project Details
Coding language: Verilog

# Problem Description
  The vending machine dispenses individual items at a cost of fifteen units. Only five and ten unit denominations are accepted as payment. The machine will provide change if applicable.

# FSM Consideration 
  The system employs a three-state model to represent the machine's monetary state: zero units (s0), five units (s1), and ten units (s2). A two-bit input is used to signify the inserted currency, with the least significant bit (LSB) corresponding to a five-unit coin and the most significant bit (MSB) representing a ten-unit coin.
